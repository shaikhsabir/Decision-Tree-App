# Decision-Tree-App: GUI web application for decision tree analysis 

Data analysis and machine learning have become an integrative part of the computer technology, offering automated 
procedures for the prediction of a phenomenon based on past observations, providing insights about the problem by 
unraveling underlying patterns in data. Real-valued data, by nature, exhibit nonlinear associations, high-order 
interactions, mixed predictors and missing values. Flexible and robust analytical methods are required to deal with 
these difficulties which should be simple to understand and interpret. A decision tree is one of the most popular and 
powerful yet simple algorithms used for real-time data analysis. Decision trees are widely used because they are easy to
explain and interpret. A decision tree is a non-parametric machine learning algorithm which can be used for classification
and regression problems. Decision trees or other machine learning algorithms are not just relevant to statistical science
but also widely used in academic and non-academic disciplines. Implementing machine learning algorithms usually demands
a thorough understanding of underlying statistical concepts and tools. However, these methods can be made easily accessible
for academic learners and non-expert users by developing Graphic user interface (GUI) applications. Point-and-click 
user-interface applications are dynamic, user-friendly, visually appealing, and publicly accessible via the web. In this 
report, development of “Decision tree App”, a Shiny web application is discussed in detail. The report also provides an
overview of the Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Random Forest, R Shiny and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm. 
The comparison is performed between the Decision tree and Random forest. Usage of all application features is illustrated 
in detail using an example dataset. Decision tree App is easy to use and does not require any statistical and programming skills.
